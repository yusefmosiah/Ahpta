## Objectives

- [ ] enable public and private conversations between multiple humans and multiple bots
- [ ] facilitate a marketplace to rent access to other users bots
- [ ] enable "breeding" multiple bots together to create a new bot owned in partnership by the owners of the preexisting bots

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
